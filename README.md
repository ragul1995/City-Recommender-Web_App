With the improvement in mobility across world city , cost now seems to be the least of the problem on "where to go". 
The **City Recommender WebApp** is a recommender engine that recommends which city to move or travel to, based on 5 features that are important to you using cosine similarity(collaborative filtering method). The data used is the 2018 Millennial Cities Ranking by [NestPick](https://www.nestpick.com/millennial-city-ranking-2018/) which was scraped using `pd.read_html`. The user-interface is solely powered by Streamlit and is then deployed to Heroku via Github
